## Modes

There are multiple modes which allow you to provide quotes for Uri to say in
different ways. Currently, there are 2 different modes, and more may come in the
future!

### TextBox

TextBox mode allows you to directly input quotes into the config field. Useful
for static quotes, or changing them quickly on the fly.

### URL

URL mode will make a HTTP request to a provided endpoint, and use the response
body as the input quotes. Could be used for more dynamic quotes, e.g. at
different times of day.
